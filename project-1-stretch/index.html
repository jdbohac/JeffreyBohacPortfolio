          <p>You stand before a stone castle that seems to be mostly rubble except for a lone room, sealed off by a large iron gate. The smell of pork chops and venison waft to you from inside. There is a path to your left that leads to a thicket and to your right a cave that stenches of Barbasol.</p>

I haven't forgotten my promise!"<br>Dennis forces a mushy bunch into your hand, it is unfortunately excrement. Dennis suddenly tramples off as fast as his meager frame can manage. You shrug and put the dung away for later use.</p>
